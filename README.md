# 10G/25G Ethernet Reference Designs for the Opsero Quad SFP28 FMC

## Description

This project demonstrates the use of the Opsero [Quad SFP28 FMC] (OP081) with 10G/25G Ethernet SFP+/SFP28 modules
and it supports several FPGA/MPSoC development boards.

## Requirements

This project is designed for version 2024.1 of the Xilinx tools (Vivado/Vitis/PetaLinux). 
If you are using an older version of the Xilinx tools, then refer to the 
[release tags](https://github.com/fpgadeveloper/sfp28-fmc-xxv/tags "releases")
to find the version of this repository that matches your version of the tools.

In order to test this design on hardware, you will need the following:

* Vivado 2024.1
* PetaLinux Tools 2024.1
* [Quad SFP28 FMC]
* One of the target platforms listed below
* [Xilinx 10G/25G Ethernet MAC/PCS (25GEMAC) License](https://www.xilinx.com/products/intellectual-property/ef-di-25gemac.html)

## Target designs

This repo contains several designs that target various supported development boards and their
FMC connectors. The table below lists the target design name, the SFP28 ports supported by the design and 
the FMC connector on which to connect the Quad SFP28 FMC. Some of the target designs
require a license to generate a bitstream with the AMD Xilinx tools.

Notes:
1. The Vivado Edition column indicates which designs are supported by the Vivado *Standard* Edition, the
   FREE edition which can be used without a license. Vivado *Enterprise* Edition requires
   a license however a 30-day evaluation license is available from the AMD Xilinx Licensing site.
2. All of the 25G designs have the `_25g` postfix in the target label.

## Software

These reference designs can be driven within a PetaLinux environment. 
The repository includes all necessary scripts and code to build the PetaLinux environments. The table 
below outlines the corresponding applications available in each environment:

| Environment      | Available Applications  |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| PetaLinux        | Built-in Linux commands<br>Additional tools: ethtool, phytool, iperf3 |

## Build instructions

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/fpgadeveloper/sfp28-fmc-xxv.git
```

Source Vivado and PetaLinux tools:

```
source <path-to-petalinux>/2024.1/settings.sh
source <path-to-vivado>/2024.1/settings64.sh
```

Build all (Vivado project and PetaLinux):

```
cd sfp28-fmc-xxv/PetaLinux
make petalinux TARGET=zcu106_hpc0
```
